# TimeBox
Time keeping in R.  Making it easy to track shit and get shit done


Thoughts on Time management

Ref Tony Robbins - RPM technique
  - there is a bucket with the backlog.  You will never get it all done - its purpose is to get stuff out of your head
  - categorise the backlog.  What are the main themes.
  - what are your priorities
  - What is the action plan - this is where time management comes in.

 (this is a bit like a sales funnel)

 How do you refine the information at each step.
 Thoughts	
 - This is what I do for work with project teams.  Building a strategy and developing a business case.  Can be applied to individuals as well.	
 - This structure provides a cleaner breakdown of the different information and functionality required.
 - Is it possible to build a single integrated interface over the top of all three functions.
 - It would be great if the tool could be re-badged for different approaches (eg Agile)
 
 Brain Dump	
 - Rapid capture of ideas.  Index + title + notes/drawings.	
 - Can get ideas into the brain dump in a number of ways, eg email, spreadsheet, .	
 
 Strategiser / Funnel
 - Where will I spend my time	
 - Categorise and synergise - mind maps or other "consulting" strategies for grouping thoughts and ideas	
 - Scoping, prioritisation, cost/benefit analysis, resourcing are the main activities in the funnel.  Creating projects.	
 - Projects contain a list of features (scope) or WBS.  Each feature ties back to ideas in the brain dump.	
 - Largely a graphical tool?	
 - [eventually] Extend the data model to cover: Strategic drivers, Projects, Scope items
 
 To Do
 - Manages getting things done.  Just like Jira / kanbanflow / trello / etc	
 - Each state has a label, and a set of rules on how the state behaves.	
 - Could define states and workflow like in Jira	
 - Lets just start with: Backlog, InProgress, Today, Done	
 - Contain a link to the strategy item which provides structure for the Time Box.  	
 - Can add tasks and activities when it goes into the ToDo list.  Breakdown the features (or "stories" or .) into discrete units of work
