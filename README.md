# TimeBox
Time keeping in R.  Making it easy to track shit and get shit done

There are a ton of approaches to time management.  There are a lot of great tools that tackle partof the problem (Trello, Jira, Office 365, ...)

I am automating what has been working for me, building an integrated toolkit that avoids reworking.

## Thoughts on Time management
Extend the _Tony Robbins - RPM technique_ to cover other adjacent tasks (eg timekeeping)
  - there is a bucket with the backlog.  You may never get it all done - its purpose is to get stuff out of your head.
  - categorise the backlog.  What are the main themes.  What are your priorities.
  - What is the action plan.
  - Where did I spend my time.

 This is a bit like a sales funnel, and other strategy based approaches for managing teams, businesses and architectures.  You refine the information at each step.

 - This is what I do for work with project teams.  Building a strategy and developing a business case.  Can be applied to individuals as well.	
 - This structure provides a cleaner breakdown of the different information and functionality required.
 - It would be great if the tool could be re-badged for different approaches (eg Agile).  A balance between specific and generic features is required.
 
### Brain Dump	
 - Rapid capture of ideas.  This is a way to capture notes which you may organise or action later.
 - Index + title + notes/drawings.
 - Can get ideas into the brain dump in a number of ways, eg email, spreadsheet, .	
 - Could be modified to operate as a journal
 - This is similar to Office Notes.  How do we get the flexibility of a graphical interface into the tool.
 
### Strategiser / Funnel
 - Where will I spend my time	
 - Categorise and synergise - mind maps or other "consulting" strategies for grouping thoughts and ideas	
 - Scoping, prioritisation, cost/benefit analysis, resourcing are the main activities in the funnel.  Creating projects.	
 - Projects contain a list of features (scope) or WBS.  Each feature ties back to ideas in the brain dump.	
 - Largely a graphical tool?	
 - [eventually] Extend the data model to cover: Strategic drivers, Projects, Scope items
 - This step really creates the lists of values that are used downstream to manage work, eg Projects/Timesheet codes/Statuses/...
 
### Tasks
 - Manages getting things done.  Just like Jira / kanbanflow / trello / etc	
 - Each state has a label, and a set of rules on how the state behaves.	
 - Could define states and workflow like in Jira	
 - Lets just start with: Backlog, InProgress, Today, Done	
 - Contain a link to the strategy item which provides structure for the Time Box.  	
 - Can add tasks and activities when it goes into the ToDo list.  Breakdown the features (or "stories" or .) into discrete units of work	
 
### Work tracker
 - What did you do?
 - Use the ToDo list to create a 'Bundy clock' that can keep you focussed, and also track your time.
 - Extract from this to create daily timesheets.
